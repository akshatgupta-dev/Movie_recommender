## Overview

The **Movie Recommendation System with Sentiment Analysis** is a web application that recommends movies to users based on their preferences and analyzes the sentiment of movie reviews. The system utilizes machine learning techniques for movie recommendations and natural language processing (NLP) for sentiment analysis. 

This project showcases skills in data science, machine learning, and full-stack web development, providing users with personalized movie recommendations and insights into movie reviews.

## Features
- **Personalized Movie Recommendations**: Suggests movies based on user ratings and preferences using collaborative filtering and content-based filtering.
- **Sentiment Analysis**: Analyzes the sentiment of user-submitted movie reviews, categorizing them as positive, negative, or neutral.
- **Web Interface**: A user-friendly web interface that allows users to input their preferences and view recommendations and sentiment analysis results.
- **Interactive Visualizations**: Displays sentiment distributions and recommendation scores for better insights.

## Technologies Used
- **Frontend**: HTML, CSS, JavaScript
- **Backend**: Python, Flask, Scikit-Learn, Hugging Face Transformers
- **Database**: SQLite or PostgreSQL
- **Machine Learning**: Pandas, Scikit-Learn, Surprise
- **Natural Language Processing**: NLTK, Transformers
- **Containerization**: Docker
- **Version Control**: Git

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
Before running the application, ensure you have the following installed on your machine:
- Python 3.6 or later
- pip (Python package installer)
- Docker (optional for containerization)

## How to Use
1. Run the Flask application:
   ```bash
   python app.py
   ```

2. Open a web browser and navigate to `http://localhost:5000` to access the application.

3. Enter your User ID to get personalized movie recommendations or submit a movie review to analyze its sentiment.

## API Endpoints
### Get Recommendations
- **Endpoint**: `/recommend`
- **Method**: POST
- **Parameters**: 
  - `user_id`: Integer (User ID for recommendations)
- **Response**: JSON object containing recommended movies.

### Analyze Sentiment
- **Endpoint**: `/sentiment`
- **Method**: POST
- **Parameters**: 
  - `review`: String (Movie review text)
- **Response**: JSON object containing sentiment analysis results.

## Running the Application
To run the application without Docker, simply execute:
```bash
python app.py
```

To run the application with Docker, follow these steps:
1. Build the Docker image:
   ```bash
   docker build -t movie-recommender .
   ```

2. Run the Docker container:
   ```bash
   docker run -p 5000:5000 movie-recommender
   ```

3. Access the application at `http://localhost:5000`.

## Dockerization
